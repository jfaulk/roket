	<h3>What is Roket?</h3>
	<p>
	    Roket is a blogging platform reimagined for the new age. It puts all content controls in the hands of the
	    users, so users - not some impenetrable algorithm - control what they see. On Roket, you can speak, hear, and be
	    heard by both those ready to both hear and listen. So long as you aren't doing anything illegal, you are free
	    to speak your mind.
	</p>

	<h3>Who is Roket?</h3>
	<p>
	    Roket is built and maintained by three Torontonians.  They are James Faulk, Jesse Fogel, and William Coddington.

	<h3>Why is Roket?</h3>
	<p>
	    Blogging sites writ large generally have pretty poor content controls afforded to users. Sure, you can block
	    specific tags, but tags are an inexact metric. A simple box of tags doesn't differentiate between content and
	    topic tags. Given how language is evolving at such a rapid pace in our digital age, it's difficult to maintain
	    a standard of content tag nomenclature.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Roket uses a revolutionary two-layer tagging system. By separating topic and content tags, we hope to make
	    responsible blogging much simpler. We also aim to have the community assist site administrators in
	    moderating content tags, so we can multiple perspectives on the same posts and accompanying tags.
